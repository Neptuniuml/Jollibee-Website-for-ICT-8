        <p>
            Jollibee’s phenomenal growth owes much to its strict and <br> committed adherence to high standards as symbolized by <br> “F.S.C.”: Food (F) served to the public must meet the company’s <br> excellence standards or it will not be served at all; the Service (S) <br> must be fast and courteous; Cleanliness (C), from kitchen to <br> utensils, must always be maintained. Jollibee is proud of its <br> employees who carry out their jobs.
