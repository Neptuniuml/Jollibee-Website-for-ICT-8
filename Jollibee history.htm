    <h4>

        Our Jollibee Group was founded in 1975 by Dr. Tony Tan Caktiong. With the help of his wife Grace, his family, and in-laws, they started everything with a small family business selling ice cream in the streets of Manila. Three years after starting, the family saw the opportunity for hot meals. They converted the ice cream parlors into the Jollibee brand we know today.
        <br><br>Tony always saw the huge potential for his business and dreamt big. He put faith in hard work, passion, and focus, to turn his then-small business into one of the biggest companies in the Philippines, Asia and now, the world.
        <br><br>Today, that dream has brought us from a single brand into a restaurant group with 19 well-loved brands and over 9,500 stores in 32 countries. Through our mission of bringing the joy of eating to everyone, we aim and continue to work to become one of the top five restaurant companies in the world.
        <br><br>Recently, the Jollibee Group signed agreements to own 10% ownership in Botrista, a leader in the beverage technology space. The Company also owns a 90% participating interest in Titan Dining Partners II Ltd to further grow Asia Pacific food service brands and/or bring strong global food service brands to Asia Pacific.
